# Stage 2 — Research & Validation Skill Architecture

# Core Philosophy

Stage 2 is centered around:

```text id="jlwm192"
validation intelligence
```

NOT:

* product structuring
* workflow decomposition
* feature categorization

Those responsibilities were completed in Stage 1.

Stage 2 is responsible for validating whether the assumptions behind the product survive real-world constraints and evidence.

The stage focuses on:

* evidence gathering
* feasibility analysis
* confidence scoring
* contradiction detection
* scalability reasoning
* assumption validation

---

# Stage 2 Core Purpose

Transform:

* product assumptions
* inferred workflows
* operational hypotheses

into:

* validated product intelligence
* evidence-backed feasibility
* architecture readiness confidence
* risk-aware product models

---

# Stage 2 Command

# Command — stage-2-research-and-validation

## Purpose

The `stage-2-research-and-validation` command orchestrates:

* assumption extraction
* validation prioritization
* evidence analysis
* confidence modeling
* validation synthesis

The command manages:

* validation sequencing
* shared validation state
* confidence progression
* completion determination

---

# Output Directory

All final Stage 2 outputs must be recorded in:

```text
Build-Plans/Stage-2/
```

The command must create this folder if it does not exist.

---

# Interactive Guidance Rules

The Stage 2 command should behave like a guided validation interview.

Use this decision rule:

```text
Ask only for validation decisions that materially affect confidence, evidence quality, or architecture readiness.
Infer low-risk validation assumptions when Stage 1 outputs and available evidence support the inference.
Record assumptions when proceeding without user confirmation.
Block only when a missing answer prevents trustworthy validation or safe Stage 3 progression.
```

Pause for user input when:

* a core assumption cannot be classified or prioritized
* evidence is too weak for an architecture-critical assumption
* a technical feasibility decision depends on an unknown constraint
* monetization or cost assumptions materially affect viability
* a contradiction cannot be resolved through evidence or mitigation
* Stage 3 readiness depends on an unresolved critical unknown

---

# Command Responsibilities

```text id="’winijlwm"
1. Load Stage 1 outputs
2. Extract assumptions
3. Classify assumptions
4. Prioritize validation targets
5. Run validation skills
6. Track confidence scores
7. Detect weak assumptions
8. Generate recommendations
9. Produce validated product model
10. Determine stage completion
```

---

# Shared Validation State

The command maintains continuously evolving validation state.

All validation skills:

* read shared state
* update confidence
* detect contradictions
* refine validation intelligence

---

# Stage 3 Handoff Contract

Stage 2 must produce a concrete Stage 3 handoff.

The `stage_3_handoff` object must include:

```json
{
  "stage_2_output_directory": "Build-Plans/Stage-2/",
  "validated_product_model": {},
  "architecture_readiness": {},
  "validated_assumption_ids": [],
  "architecture_critical_assumption_ids": [],

  "recommended_architecture_focus": [],
  "completion_status": {}
}
```

---

# Traceability Rules

Every Stage 2 finding must trace back to one or more Stage 1 source IDs or files.

Every Stage 2 output should preserve:

```text
Stage 1 feature/workflow/dependency/risk -> assumption ID -> validation finding -> confidence score -> Stage 3 architecture implication
```

}
```

# Shared State Updates

```text id="’winijlwm19"

```

---

# Recommended Completion Philosophy

Stage 2 completion should NOT mean:

```text id="’winijlwm20"
"All research completed."
```

Instead it should mean:

```text id="’winijlwm21"
"The product assumptions have been sufficiently validated for safe architectural progression."
```

---

# Recommended Completion Criteria

Before Stage 2 may use `ready_for_stage_3`, it must run `global-stage-readiness-audit` and write:

```text
Build-Plans/Build-status/Stage-2-readiness-audit.json
```

The audit must pass according to:

```text
System-References/Docs/Global-Stage-Workflow-Contract.md
```

Stage 2 is complete when:

| Domain       | Requirement                       |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Market       | Viability confidence acceptable   |
| Users        | User problems validated           |
| Competition  | Competitive landscape understood  |
| Technical    | Feasibility validated             |
| Monetization | Business viability acceptable     |
| Operations   | Operational risks identified      |
| Scalability  | Major scaling blockers understood |

AND:

```text id="’winijlwm22"
No critical unknowns remain unresolved.
```

---

# Assumption Registry

Stage 2 should maintain a centralized assumption registry.

---

# Evidence Quality Rules

Every Stage 2 finding must distinguish:

```text
evidence-backed finding
inference
unsupported assumption
critical unknown
```

Evidence entries must use:

```json
{
  "evidence_id": "",
  "claim_or_assumption_id": "",
  "source_type": "primary | secondary | user_provided | inferred | unavailable",
  "source_url": "",
  "source_date": "",
  "freshness": "current | recent | stale | unknown",
  "evidence_quality": "none | low | medium | high",
  "confidence_effect": "increase | decrease | neutral",
  "confidence_delta": 0.0,
  "summary": "",
  "is_inference": false,
  "limitations": [],
  "requires_external_research": false
}
```

Architecture-critical assumptions cannot be marked `validated` unless evidence quality is `medium` or `high`, the risk is explicitly accepted and carried into Stage 3, or the assumption remains a critical unknown blocking architecture progression.

---

# Example Structure

```json id="’winijlwm23"
{
  "id": "",
  "assumption": "Users trust AI-generated schedules",
  "domain": "user_validation",
  "source_stage_1_file": "",
  "explicit_or_implicit": "",
  "architecture_critical": false,
  "confidence": 0.73,
  "validation_sources": [],
  "risk_if_false": "high",
  "status": "unvalidated",
  "evidence": [],
  "evidence_quality": "none",
  "contradictions": [],
  "next_action": ""
}
```

This registry becomes:

* the validation backbone
* the confidence engine
* the progression gating layer

---

# Evidence, Confidence, And Risk Rules

Findings must distinguish:

```text
evidence
inference
assumption
recommendation
```

Unsupported claims must be marked as assumptions.

When external research is unavailable, record the limitation in `critical_unknowns` and mark affected recommendations as provisional.

When external research is used, include source links in `evidence`.

Minimum readiness thresholds:

```json
{
  "market_confidence_min": 0.70,
  "technical_confidence_min": 0.75,
  "business_confidence_min": 0.65,
  "operational_confidence_min": 0.70,
  "architecture_readiness_min": 0.75
}
```

High and critical risks must include mitigation paths.

Critical open contradictions block Stage 3 progression.

# Final Output Schemas

```json

}
```

`02-competitive-landscape.json` must follow this structure:

```

`04-business-viability.json` must follow this structure:

  "growth_risks": [],
  "scalability_analysis": {},

# Final Stage 2 Philosophy

# Stage 1

```text id="’winijlwm24"
"What are we building?"
```

# Stage 2

```text id="’winijlwm25"
"Do the assumptions behind this product survive reality?"
```

This creates a clean cognition boundary between:

* product synthesis
  and
* evidence-backed validation.

---

# Final Definition

Stage 2 is:

```text id="’winijlwm26"
an evidence-driven validation cognition framework
```

designed to transform:

* product assumptions
* inferred operational models
* strategic hypotheses

into:

* validated product intelligence
* risk-aware feasibility analysis
* architecture-ready confidence models.

---

# A-Grade Workflow Compliance

Stage 2 must consume `stage_contract_profile` and `guidance_policy`.

Stage 2 output validation should reference:

```text
System-References/Schemas/stage-2-output.schema.json
```

Stage 2 evidence findings should create or reference artifacts in:

```text
Build-Plans/Build-status/Artifact-evidence-registry.json
```

Architecture-critical assumptions require evidence quality of `medium` or higher unless explicitly accepted as risk.

Stage 2 readiness must also record:

```json
{
  "schema_validation": {},
  "reference_integrity": {},
  "risk_acceptance_ledger": {},
  "revision_loops": []
}
```

Stage 2 may not use `ready_for_stage_3` until required schema validation passes, assumption and evidence references resolve to Stage 1 sources, accepted high and critical validation risks are written to `Build-Plans/Build-status/Risk-acceptance-ledger.json`, and failed readiness checks are converted into revision-loop actions.
