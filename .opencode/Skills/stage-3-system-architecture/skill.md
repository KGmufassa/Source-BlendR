# Command — stage-3-system-architecture

# Purpose

The `stage-3-system-architecture` command orchestrates Stage 3.

It transforms:

* Stage 1 product structures
* Stage 2 validation intelligence
* architecture readiness findings
* validated assumptions
* known risks and constraints

into:

* technical system topology
* service architecture
* data architecture
* API architecture
* integration model
* security foundations
* infrastructure model
* scalability framework

This is the Stage 3 command skill. It is not a single architecture subskill.

---

# Cognitive Boundary

Stage 3 asks:

```text
How should the validated product be technically structured?
```

Stage 3 must not:

* redefine the product concept
* perform market validation
* design detailed user interfaces
* write implementation tickets
* produce production deployment scripts

Stage 3 may recommend product or validation revisions only when architecture analysis exposes a blocking contradiction.

---

# Output Directory

All final Stage 3 outputs must be recorded in:

```text
Build-Plans/Stage-3/
```

The command must create this folder if it does not exist.

---

# Shared Architecture State

The command maintains a shared Stage 3 architecture state object.

The shared architecture state must be written to:

```text
Build-Plans/Build-status/Architecture-state.json
```

The command must load this file at the beginning of Stage 3, update it after each architecture skill runs, and preserve it as the durable architecture state for the build.

```json
{
  "stage": "Stage 3",
  "command": "stage-3-system-architecture",
  "status": "not_started",
  "stage_1_inputs": {},
  "stage_2_inputs": {},
  "preflight": {},
  "architecture_drivers": [],
  "architecture_decisions": [],
  "selected_stack": {
    "frontend": {},
    "backend": {},
    "database": {},
    "storage": {},
    "authentication": {},
    "hosting_and_deployment": {},
    "testing_stack": {},
    "package_manager": "",
    "ai_and_external_services": [],
    "rationale": "",
    "rejected_alternatives": [],
    "risks": []
  },
  "stack_decision_status": {},
  "rejected_stack_alternatives": [],
  "system_topology": {},
  "service_architecture": {},
  "data_architecture": {},
  "api_architecture": {},
  "integration_architecture": {},
  "security_foundations": {},
  "infrastructure_model": {},
  "scalability_framework": {},
  "architecture_risks": [],
  "tradeoffs": [],
  "open_questions": [],
  "interactive_guidance": {
    "open_questions": [],
    "answered_questions": [],
    "assumptions_made": [],
    "blocked_decisions": [],
    "user_confirmations": [],
    "architecture_confidence_gaps": []
  },
  "stage_4_handoff": {},
  "stage_5_handoff": {},
  "completion_status": {}
}
```

Each subskill reads the current architecture state and writes its updates back into the shared state before the next skill runs.

After each subskill completes, the command must persist the updated shared state to:

```text
Build-Plans/Build-status/Architecture-state.json
```

---

# Interactive Guidance Rules

The Stage 3 command should behave like a guided architecture decision interview.

Use this decision rule:

```text
Ask only for architecture decisions that materially affect system design.
Infer standard technical defaults when risk is low and the product model supports the inference.
Record assumptions when proceeding without user confirmation.
Block only when a missing decision prevents coherent architecture.
```

When asking the user questions:

* ask 1-3 questions at a time
* prioritize architecture-blocking decisions first
* avoid asking questions already answered by Stage 1 or Stage 2 outputs
* explain the architectural consequence of each question
* prefer concrete options over open-ended questions when the tradeoff is known
* update `interactive_guidance.open_questions`
* move answered questions into `interactive_guidance.answered_questions`
* record inferred defaults in `interactive_guidance.assumptions_made`
* record unresolved blockers in `interactive_guidance.blocked_decisions`

The command should continue automatically when a decision has a low-risk default.

The command should pause for user input when:

* data ownership is unclear
* user roles or permissions materially affect service boundaries
* an external integration is required but unspecified
* AI processing requires a major architecture choice
* synchronous vs asynchronous workflow behavior changes the topology
* sensitive data handling is unclear
* scalability expectations materially affect infrastructure choices
* a Stage 2 risk cannot be mitigated through architecture

The command should not ask the user to choose implementation details that can be deferred to Stage 5 unless the decision changes Stage 3 architecture.

---

# Concrete Stack Decision Rules

Stage 3 must select one concrete implementation stack before completion.

The command may compare alternatives, but it must collapse them into a single selected stack before final synthesis.

The selected stack must include concrete choices for:

```text
frontend framework
frontend language
styling approach
backend framework
backend runtime
API style
primary database
ORM or query layer
authentication provider or strategy
hosting and deployment model
testing stack
package manager
AI providers or none_for_mvp
storage provider or none_for_mvp
```

Selection rules:

* choose the best-fit stack using Stage 2 feasibility, product complexity, known risks, skill availability, implementation speed, scalability, security, cost, and operational burden
* record rejected alternatives with rationale
* use `none_for_mvp` for stack areas intentionally excluded from the MVP
* do not leave unresolved choices such as `or`, `TBD`, `to decide later`, `optional`, or `depends`
* if the user rejects the stack, update `stack_decision_status`, revise `selected_stack`, and regenerate affected architecture outputs before completion

Stage 3 must block completion when `selected_stack` is missing, incomplete, or contains unresolved alternatives.

```text
Build-Plans/Stage-1/
```

Load Stage 2 outputs from:

```text

# Preflight Validation

Before architecture design, validate:

* Stage 1 outputs exist and are readable
* Stage 2 outputs exist and are readable
* architecture readiness status is acceptable
* critical unknowns from Stage 2 are resolved or mitigated
* validated assumptions are available
* high and critical risks have mitigation paths
* MVP scope is clear enough to architecture

Record preflight results in:

```text
preflight
architecture_risks
open_questions
interactive_guidance
completion_status
```

# Stage Decision Brief

Before final synthesis, `ready_for_stage_4`, or Stage 5 architecture handoff, generate:

```text
Build-Plans/Stage-3/00-stage-decision-brief.md
```

The brief confirms the selected concrete architecture stack before UX/UI planning and build orchestration.

The brief must present one selected concrete stack, not multiple unresolved options.

Ask:

```text
Do you approve this selected concrete stack for the build?
```

Allowed user decisions:

```text
Approve tech stack
Change frontend stack
Change backend stack
Change database/auth/deployment
Choose simpler architecture
Choose more scalable architecture
```

Record the brief in shared architecture state as `stage_decision_brief`.

Do not use `ready_for_stage_4` or send Stage 5 architecture handoff unless:

```text
selected_stack is complete
selected_stack contains no unresolved alternatives
stage_decision_brief.approval_status = approved
```

---

# Completion Gate

Before Stage 3 may use `ready_for_stage_4`, run `global-stage-readiness-audit`.

The audit must write:

```text
Build-Plans/Build-status/Stage-3-readiness-audit.json
```

The audit must pass according to:

```text
System-References/Docs/Global-Stage-Workflow-Contract.md
```

If the audit does not pass, do not use `ready_for_stage_4`.

Stage 3 may complete only when:

* all eight architecture outputs exist
* system topology is defined
* service boundaries are clear enough for implementation planning
* data ownership is defined
* API surfaces are mapped to workflows
* integrations and infrastructure are defined
* selected concrete stack is complete and approved
* security foundations are present
* scalability framework exists
* high and critical architecture risks have mitigation paths
* critical interactive guidance questions are answered or converted into recorded assumptions
* no architecture-blocking Stage 2 unknowns remain unresolved
* Stage 3 decision brief exists and is approved

Possible completion statuses:

```text
ready_for_stage_4
needs_architecture_revision
needs_stage_2_revalidation
blocked
```

---

# Validation Checklist

Before completing Stage 3, confirm:

* Stage 3 did not redefine product strategy
* Stage 3 did not perform UX screen design
* Stage 3 did not write implementation tickets
* every major capability maps to a system or service
* every core workflow is supported by the architecture
* every data entity has an owner
* every external dependency has an integration strategy
* selected stack has exactly one concrete choice for frontend, backend, database, auth, deployment, testing, and package manager
* rejected stack alternatives are recorded with rationale
* security and scalability risks are recorded
* critical interactive guidance questions are answered or converted into recorded assumptions
* Stage 4 handoff is usable for UX architecture
* Stage 5 handoff is usable for development orchestration
* Stage 3 decision brief approval is recorded before Stage 4 or Stage 5 handoff is used

---

# A-Grade Workflow Compliance

Stage 3 must consume `stage_contract_profile` and `guidance_policy`.

Stage 3 must reference:

```text
System-References/Schemas/stage-3-output.schema.json
```

Architecture decisions should reference Stage 2 evidence quality and create artifacts when architecture proof, diagrams, or decision records are produced.

Those artifacts should be recorded or referenced in:

```text
Build-Plans/Build-status/Artifact-evidence-registry.json
```

Before using `ready_for_stage_4`, Stage 3 must provide `schema_validation`, `reference_integrity`, `risk_acceptance_ledger`, and `revision_loops` in the readiness audit or stage state.

Accepted high and critical architecture risks must be recorded in:

```text
Build-Plans/Build-status/Risk-acceptance-ledger.json
```

Failed readiness checks must become revision-loop actions with owning output, owning skill, required change, and next action.
