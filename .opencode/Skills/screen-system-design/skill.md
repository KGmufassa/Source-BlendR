# Skill — screen-system-design

# Purpose

The `screen-system-design` skill defines the screen architecture needed to support user journeys and interactions.

It determines:

* screens
* screen groups
* layout responsibilities
* information hierarchy
* navigation structure
* role-based screen access
* MVP screen boundaries

This skill is the screen architecture layer for Stage 4.

# Inputs

```json
{
  "user_journeys": {},
  "interaction_architecture": {},
  "feature_structure": {},
  "data_architecture": {},
  "security_foundations": {},
  "existing_state": {}
}
```

Read and update shared UX state from:

# Core Responsibilities

## Screen Architecture

Define:

* required screens
* screen purpose
* screen inputs
* screen outputs
* screen-level user actions
* screen data requirements
* screen permissions
* screen relationships

## Screen System Consistency

Validate:

* screens map to journeys
* screens support feature behavior
* screen groups are coherent
* navigation is complete
* MVP screens are not over-scoped

## Interactive Element Mapping

Each screen must enumerate every interactive element (buttons, links, inputs) it contains:

```json
{
  "screen_id": "",
  "name": "",
  "route_or_location_hint": "",
  "owning_journey_ids": [],
  "supported_feature_ids": [],
  "role_access": [],
  "required_data": [],
  "user_actions": [],
  "system_actions": [],
  "states": [],
  "interactive_elements": [
    {
      "element_id": "",
      "element_type": "button | link | icon_button | menu_item | tab | toggle | checkbox | radio | select | text_input | search_input | file_upload | date_picker",
      "label": "",
      "route_target": "",
      "action_id": "",
      "behavior": "navigate | submit | open_modal | open_drawer | toggle | trigger_action | open_link | download | call_api | scroll_to",
      "behavior_target": "",
      "permission_required": "",
      "confirmation_required": false,
      "states": {},
      "owning_component": "",
      "owning_section": ""
    }
  ],
  "responsive_requirements": [],
  "accessibility_requirement_ids": [],
  "stage_5_ticket_hints": []
}
```

Every screen's interactive_elements must be cross-referenced with the UI blueprint's section -> component -> interactive_elements hierarchy during ui-blueprint-specification.

## Screen Risk Detection

Identify:

* missing screens
* redundant screens
* unclear screen ownership
* overloaded screens
* role-based access confusion
* unsupported workflow steps

# Interactive Guidance Responsibilities

This skill should guide the user through screen decisions that affect workflow completeness or interface consistency.

Ask targeted questions when any of these are unclear:

* whether a workflow step needs its own screen
* whether admin/operator screens are required
* which screens are MVP-critical
* how role-based access changes screens
* whether a screen should support creation, editing, review, or reporting
* whether a dashboard, detail view, or list view is needed

Infer standard screen patterns when the journey is simple and low-risk.

Record assumptions in:

```text
interactive_guidance.assumptions_made
```

Pause for user input when screen architecture affects journey completion, permissions, or Stage 5 implementation scope.

# Validation Responsibilities

Validate:

* every required journey has screen support
* screen inventory maps to launch-critical features
* role-based access is represented
* screen risks are recorded
* every screen records its interactive elements with route_targets and behavior
* every interactive element references a valid route or action
