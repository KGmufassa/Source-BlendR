# Skill — screen-system-design

# Purpose

The `screen-system-design` skill defines the screen architecture needed to support user journeys and interactions.

It determines:

* screens
* screen groups
* layout responsibilities
* information hierarchy
* navigation structure
* role-based screen access
* MVP screen boundaries

This skill is the screen architecture layer for Stage 4.

# Inputs

```json
{
  "user_journeys": {},
  "interaction_architecture": {},
  "feature_structure": {},
  "data_architecture": {},
  "security_foundations": {},
  "existing_state": {}
}
```

Read and update shared UX state from:

# Core Responsibilities

## Screen Architecture

Define:

* required screens
* screen purpose
* screen inputs
* screen outputs
* screen-level user actions
* screen data requirements
* screen permissions
* screen relationships

## Screen System Consistency

Validate:

* screens map to journeys
* screens support feature behavior
* screen groups are coherent
* navigation is complete
* MVP screens are not over-scoped

## Screen Risk Detection

Identify:

* missing screens
* redundant screens
* unclear screen ownership
* overloaded screens
* role-based access confusion
* unsupported workflow steps

---

# Interactive Guidance Responsibilities

This skill should guide the user through screen decisions that affect workflow completeness or interface consistency.

Ask targeted questions when any of these are unclear:

* whether a workflow step needs its own screen
* whether admin/operator screens are required
* which screens are MVP-critical
* how role-based access changes screens
* whether a screen should support creation, editing, review, or reporting
* whether a dashboard, detail view, or list view is needed

Infer standard screen patterns when the journey is simple and low-risk.

Record assumptions in:

interactive_guidance.assumptions_made
```

Pause for user input when screen architecture affects journey completion, permissions, or Stage 5 implementation scope.

# Validation Responsibilities

Validate:
