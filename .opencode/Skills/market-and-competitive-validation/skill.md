# Skill — market-and-competitive-validation

# Purpose

The `market-and-competitive-validation` skill validates:

* market demand
* audience viability
* user pain validity
* workflow realism
* competitive landscape
* differentiation viability
* positioning opportunities

This skill is the market intelligence and competitive validation engine for Stage 2.

# Inputs

```json
{
  "assumptions": {},
  "product_identity": {},
  "user_profiles": {},
  "workflows": {},
  "existing_state": {}
}
```

# Evidence Quality Responsibilities

Market and competitive findings must record source type, freshness, evidence quality, confidence delta, inference status, limitations, and whether external research is still required.

Low-evidence positioning or demand claims must be marked provisional.

Read and update shared validation state from:

Build-Plans/Build-status/Validation-state.json

# Core Responsibilities

## Market Validation

Determine:

* demand strength
* audience viability
* market timing
* market maturity
* adoption likelihood

## Competitive Analysis

Identify:

* direct competitors
* indirect competitors
* existing alternatives
* saturation risk
* differentiation opportunities
* switching barriers

## User Validation

Validate:

* user pain realism
* workflow realism
* habit-change difficulty
* user motivation strength
* willingness to adopt

## Positioning Analysis

Determine:

* product positioning
* category alignment
* strategic differentiation
* competitive advantages
* weak positioning claims

# Interactive Guidance Responsibilities

This skill should guide the user through validation gaps that affect market, user, competitor, or positioning confidence.

Ask targeted questions when any of these are unclear:

* target market or audience segment
* primary user pain
* existing alternatives users rely on
* direct or indirect competitors
* differentiation claim
* adoption barrier
* willingness-to-pay signal
* positioning category

Ask no more than 1-3 market validation questions at once.

Infer low-risk market or competitor assumptions only when Stage 1 and available evidence strongly support them, but record them in:

```text
interactive_guidance.assumptions_made
```

Pause for user input when:

* the target audience is too broad or ambiguous
* competitor category is unclear
* differentiation cannot be validated
* user pain is weak or unsupported
* market confidence cannot reach threshold without user-provided evidence

# Evidence Rules

Separate:

```text
evidence
inference
assumption
recommendation
```

When external research is unavailable, record the limitation as a critical unknown or validation recommendation.

When external sources are used, include source links in `evidence`.

Low-evidence recommendations must be marked provisional.

# Shared State Updates

```

# Assumption Registry Behavior

For every market, user, or competitive assumption reviewed:

* update its status
* add evidence or mark evidence gap
* update confidence
* add contradiction IDs when needed
* set next action

Do not produce isolated findings that are disconnected from assumption IDs.

---

# Risk Detection

Record risks for:

* weak demand
* narrow audience
* crowded market
* unclear differentiation
* difficult habit change
* low willingness to pay
* unsupported positioning claims
