# Skill — design-system-foundation

# Purpose

The `design-system-foundation` skill defines the shared visual system that all Stage 4 UI blueprints must follow.

It produces an implementation-ready design contract without generating frontend code.

It defines:

* design system identity
* color tokens
* typography tokens
* spacing scale
* radius rules
* elevation and shadow rules
* icon rules
* button styles
* card styles
* form styles
* table styles
* modal and drawer styles
* navigation styles
* responsive breakpoints
* visual reference handling
* design approval status

This skill turns page-level visual intent into a shared UI consistency foundation.

# Operating Rule

Do not generate frontend code or mockups.

Do not ask broad questions such as:

```text
What should the app look like?
```

Use structured choices and targeted confirmation questions to define a reusable design system.

---

# Visual Reference Selection

Use the visual direction library as source material for structured design decisions, not as loose inspiration.

Read first:

```text
.opencode/Skills/design-system-foundation/references/visual-direction-index.md
```

Then select the smallest useful reference set:

* one primary visual reference
* zero or one secondary visual reference as a modifier
* rejected references when they were plausible but not suitable

Read only the selected reference files after consulting the index.

Record why each selected reference fits the product category, primary users, launch-critical surfaces, density needs, accessibility constraints, and Stage 4 visual specs.

Reject references that conflict with:

* launch-critical workflow clarity
* required information density
* accessibility or contrast needs
* product trust requirements
* implementation feasibility for Stage 5

Convert selected references into design-system tokens and rules before UI blueprints apply them.

The traceability path is:

```text
visual style reference -> design system -> UI blueprint visual spec -> Stage 5 ticket -> Stage 6 visual QA
```

# Interactive Guidance Responsibilities

Ask the user to confirm or choose:

* product visual personality
* design style
* color direction
* typography feel
* density and spacing
* component style direction
* visual references
* primary visual reference
* secondary visual reference when needed
* liked and disliked patterns
* approval status for the shared design system

Ask no more than 1-3 design-system questions at once.

Infer low-risk defaults only when they are strongly implied by the product category and visual specs. Record assumptions in:

```text
interactive_guidance.assumptions_made
```

Pause for user input when:

* launch-critical visual specs conflict with each other
* product visual personality is unclear
* no primary visual reference can be selected from the visual direction index
* color or typography direction is missing
* component style rules are too vague for frontend implementation
* responsive breakpoints or collapse rules are missing
* design approval status is unconfirmed

---

# Shared State Updates

Update:

```text

visual_spec_inventory
stage_5_handoff
interactive_guidance
ux_confidence_gaps
```

Persist updates to:

```text
Build-Plans/Build-status/UX-state.json
```

---

# Validation Responsibilities

Validate:

* shared design system exists for launch-critical frontend work
* design system includes color, typography, spacing, radius, elevation, icon, component, and responsive rules
* design system records selected visual references, liked patterns, disliked patterns, and accessibility constraints when provided
* selected visual references are converted into tokens, component rules, responsive rules, and accessibility constraints
* rejected visual references include a reason when they were plausible candidates
* launch-critical UI blueprints reference or align with the design system
* design approval status is recorded
* Stage 5 can consume the design system without inventing visual direction
* no frontend code is generated
