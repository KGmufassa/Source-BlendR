# Skill — monitoring-systems-planning

# Purpose

The `monitoring-systems-planning` skill defines the operational monitoring model for production.

It plans:

* health checks
* logs
* alerts
* uptime checks
* incident triggers
* monitoring risks

---

# Core Responsibilities

## Monitoring Model

Define:

* system health signals
* application logs
* error tracking needs
* uptime checks

## Coverage Gaps

Identify launch-critical behavior that cannot be monitored yet and record it as a risk or setup action.
