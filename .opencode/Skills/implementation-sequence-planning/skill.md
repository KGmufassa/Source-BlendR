# Skill — implementation-sequence-planning

# Purpose

The `implementation-sequence-planning` skill converts the roadmap into an ordered build sequence.

It determines:

* implementation order
* vertical slices
* foundational build steps
* feature sequencing
* dependency-aware task ordering
* Stage 6 execution readiness

This skill is the build sequencing layer for Stage 5.

# Core Responsibilities

## Sequence Planning

Define:

* foundation-first work
* service implementation order
* data model implementation order
* API implementation order
* UX implementation order
* UI blueprint implementation order
* shared component implementation order
* integration implementation order
* validation checkpoints

## Slice Definition

Identify:

* end-to-end slices
* workflow-based slices
* page-based frontend slices
* shared component slices
* infrastructure setup slices
* integration slices
* testing slices

## Sequence Risk Detection

Identify:

* blocked work
* premature feature work
* hidden prerequisites
* risky late integrations
* page work scheduled before shared layout, route, or component foundations
* missing validation checkpoints

---

# Interactive Guidance Responsibilities

Guide the user through sequencing decisions that affect engineering feasibility.

Ask targeted questions when any of these are unclear:

* whether to build by feature, workflow, service, or vertical slice
* which workflow should be implemented first
* whether risky integrations should be built early
* whether manual workflows are acceptable initially
* whether foundation work should precede user-facing work
* what must be demonstrable at each milestone

Infer a vertical-slice-first approach when product and UX workflows are clear, but record the assumption in:

```text
interactive_guidance.assumptions_made
```

Pause for user input when sequencing affects risk, timeline, validation, or implementation feasibility.

# Validation Responsibilities

Validate:

* every launch-critical workflow has a build path
* frontend sequencing uses the Stage 4 frontend build package when available
* shared components, layout systems, navigation, and route foundations precede dependent page work
* foundational infrastructure and data work precedes dependent features
* integrations are not pushed so late that they threaten release readiness
* each implementation slice has a validation checkpoint
* unresolved blockers are recorded in `open_questions` or `interactive_guidance.blocked_decisions`
