# Skill — workflow-and-capability-synthesis

# Purpose

The `workflow-and-capability-synthesis` skill is responsible for transforming:

* user goals
* operational intentions
* product behaviors

into:

* structured workflows
* operational product systems
* capability architecture
* feature structures
* operational product topology

This skill acts as the operational decomposition engine of the harness.

# Core Responsibilities

## Workflow Inference

Infer:

* user flows
* operational sequences
* system interactions
* product journeys

---

## Capability Categorization

Identify:

* major product systems
* operational domains
* system groupings
* platform capabilities

Examples:

* Authentication
* AI Processing
* Collaboration
* Notifications
* Payments
* Analytics

---

## Feature Structuring

Organize:

* concrete functionality
* feature groups
* capability-linked features
* feature relationships

---

## Workflow Normalization

Transform:

* vague flows
* duplicated actions
* inconsistent behaviors

into:

* coherent operational workflows

---

## Operational Boundary Detection

Identify:

* system boundaries
* ownership domains
* operational separations
* capability segmentation

---

# Interactive Guidance Responsibilities

This skill should guide the user from product intent into concrete operational workflows.

Ask targeted questions when any of these are unclear:

* primary workflow
* workflow start state
* workflow end state
* user roles
* required user actions
* required system actions
* collaboration requirements
* workflow frequency
* feature boundaries

Ask no more than 1-3 workflow questions at once.

Infer common workflow steps when they are standard for the product category, but record them in:

```text
interactive_guidance.assumptions_made
```

Pause for user input when:

* the core workflow cannot be inferred
* user roles change the workflow architecture
* collaboration or permissions materially affect the product model
* the boundary between features and capabilities is unclear

# Inputs

```json id="jlwm94"
{
  "product_identity": {},
  "user_profiles": {},
  "strategic_intent": {},
  "recommendations": {},
  "existing_state": {}
}
```

# Outputs

Record this skill's Stage 1 outputs in:

```text
Build-Plans/Stage-1/
```

```json id="jlwm95"
{
  "workflows": {},
  "capabilities": {},
  "feature_groups": {},
  "operational_boundaries": {},
  "workflow_relationships": {},
  "capability_dependencies": {}
}
```

Write or update these files:

```text
Build-Plans/Stage-1/03-workflow-architecture.json
Build-Plans/Stage-1/04-product-capabilities.json
Build-Plans/Stage-1/05-feature-structure.json
Build-Plans/Stage-1/06-product-boundaries.json
```

Use `03-workflow-architecture.json` for workflows, journeys, workflow sequencing, and workflow relationships.
Use `04-product-capabilities.json` for capability groups, operational domains, and capability dependencies.
Use `05-feature-structure.json` for feature groups, feature relationships, and capability-linked functionality.
Use `06-product-boundaries.json` for operational boundaries, system boundaries, and ownership separations.

When recording outputs, preserve existing valid content in these files and update only the sections this skill owns.
